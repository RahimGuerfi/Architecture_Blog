## Project Goals

In this project, you’ll build an avant-garde website using the CSS Grid Layout.

You can view a live version of this project [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-grid/project-iii/index.html).

Notice that each section of the website has 3 elements — an image, `a` title, and a subtitle, and they go in alphabetical order, so image a goes with title `b` and subtitle `c`, and so forth.
